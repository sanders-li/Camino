# Camino
Travel Route Optimization

## Purpose

Camino is designed to allow one to easily create a multi-day travel iternerary that is optimized for efficiency.
Given a list of locations and business hours, along with user preferences, the algorithm is able to determine a series of routes that minimizes time spent traveling.

Example: 3 day vacation plan in Tokyo, Japan. User preferences currently factored: time spent at each location, active hours.
